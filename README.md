# BigData Project Assignment: 

Developed a knowlegde base, which allows users to mine genomic data of Alzheimer's Disease Patients. 
Given Raw Data files: 
• Gene interaction (entrez id)
• Expression profile (entrez id)
• Entrez id uniprot mapping (entrez id -> uniprot id)
• Uniprot KB and Schema (uniprot id)
• Patient information

The knowledge base answers the following questions 
– Given a gene, find all of its n-order interacting
genes
– Given a gene, find mean and std of gene
expression values for AD/MCI/NCI, respectively
– Given a gene, find all other information associated
with this gene.
– Given a patient id, find all patient information (age,
gender, education etc.)
